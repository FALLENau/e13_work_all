MVP for project
Burger Tracker
Jarrod has an insatiable hunger for burgers. However, he only has a limited budget, so prefers to go to places that have a deal on. He would like a way to track which deals are available at which places on a given day so that he can maximise his burger intake for minimum spending.

MVP:
	•	Add a burger eatery
	•	Add burgers available at an eatery and view them as a list
	•	Add a list of deals for an eatery where a deal has
	◦	Label string e.g. "Two For One Tuesdays"
	◦	A list of burgers that deal applies to
	◦	The day that the deal is available on e.g. "Wednesday"

Possible Extensions:
	•	Show the deals available by day of the week Mon - Sun
	•	Add a price to a burger and add a savings amount/percentage to a deal so it's clear how much Jarrod is saving
	•	Any other ideas you might come up with

Also test place for git block_push
	1.Git push terminal command removed push action within the .git file: {~ git remote set-url --push origin no_push }

	2.and change? nope! succsess!

	3.repairs: basically I had to revert the .git/hooks folder back to an original state, this was achieved by making a new git init then copying the hooks folder but could be achieved by just changing the file over too{.git/hooks/pre-push.sample}
